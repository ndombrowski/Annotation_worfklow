An HTML discussing the full workflow can be found under the **docs** folder.

This workflow provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to:

- download two genomes from NCBI and
- annotate them using several databases such as the COGs, arCOGS, KOs, PFAM, â€¦
- combine the results into one comprehensive table.

This repository provides:

- a detailed, step by step guide on how to annotate microbial genomes (both html and raw md document)
- example files generated during this workflow
- custom scripts that might be needed to run this workflow

All databases are avail. on ada and most of the used databases have been uploaded with a previous publication and can be found on Zenodo.
