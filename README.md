An HTML discussing the full workflow can be found under the **docs** folder.

This workflow provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to:

- download two genomes from NCBI and
- annotate them using several databases such as the COGs, arCOGS, KOs, PFAM, â€¦
- combine the results into one comprehensive table.

This repository provides:

- a detailed, step by step guide on how to annotate microbial genomes (both html and raw md document)
- example files generated during this workflow
- custom scripts that might be needed to run this workflow

Example output files for all steps can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/ndombrowski/Annotation_workflow/tree/main/Output_example).

All databases and custom scripts are available on ada. If you use this work please cite: Dombrowski, N. et al. Undinarchaeota illuminate DPANN phylogeny and the impact of gene transfer on archaeal evolution. Nature Communications 11, 3939 (2020).
